#User input and output [main.cpp lines 2-8](/main.cpp), [player.cpp line1](/player.cpp), [player.h line1-4](player.h)
I use these input and ouput because my code contians these parts.For example, I have vector in my code, so I need to have #include<vector> as one of my headers. 
##Control flow [main.cpp lines 63-113](/main.cpp),[main.cpp lines 141-153](/main.cpp).
 I use if, else if, else here in order to provide serveral choices to my users, and I also need to have control flow to make sure my code runs logically.
###Liternation: do-while loop:[main.cpp lines 27-120](/main.cpp), for loop [main.cpp lines 126-132](/main.cpp).
 I use loops here in order to make sure I can run wither part of or entire code again and again. 
####Vector[main.cpp lines 66-73,126-133](/main.cpp)
  I use vector here because I want to list the user's status in a two dimentional way. 
#####functions:
  non-void return[main.cpp lines 124-133](/main.cpp).I used a print vector function here to list all of my status. 
  void return[player.h lines 3-17](/player.h). I used this function to get player's name and combine their first and last name    together. 
  pass-by-reference[main.cpp lines 138-153].I used this function to arrange my player's status after playing the game.
######File input/output:[main.cpp lines 121-124](/main.cpp), [result.txt line 1](/result.txt)
  I used input/output here to "tell" users they are playing the game like a warrior!
#######class[player.h lines 6-19](/player.h)
  I used a class here to get users name, and I also have private and public parts in the class
